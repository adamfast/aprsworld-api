This is a complete project instead of an app. That does violate the
best-practice of being reusable, simply because the application needs
to connect to a database that the user of this application does not
own - so you can't store any of your own stuff in it. For that reason,
this application will need to be run on its own and the data it provides
ingested by some other means (if you're using Django, I recommend my
django-locationtracking project.)

INSTALLATION:
	Install it like you would any other Django application running on your server.
	You will need a username/password for the aprsworld database. This can
		be obtained by contacting the person listed on www.aprsworld.net.
	The settings file requires nothing special, but I'm not including it here.
		You don't need to put any of the apps in INSTALLED_APPS for it to work.
	Make sure you point to the templates/ dir in your TEMPLATE_DIRS setting or
		else when you turn debug off Django will error. The templates there are
		empty files, you can customize them to do whatever you wish.
